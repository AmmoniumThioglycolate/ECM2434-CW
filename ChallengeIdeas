Challenge ideas:

	Non-location specific:
	
		- Use reusable cup/bottle
		- Make a pledge to prevent food waste
		- Use Students On The Move(SOTM) scheme
		- Wash laundry at 30 degrees
		- Use a sustainable mode of transport for your next trip to campus
		- Make sustainable food choices
	
	Location specific:
	
		- Harrison Building solar panels
			ยง The installation of 700 photovoltaic (PV) solar panels on the roof of the Harrison building reduces the reliance on fossil fuels and is moving the University towards clean renewable energy. The panels will save 45,282 Kg CO2 a year and the estimated output is 212,591 kWh a year.
	
		- Reed Pond
			ยง Learn about biodiversity
	
		- Electric vehicle charging stations - pod point 
			ยง Electric vehicle (EV) charging stations support sustainable transportation by encouraging the use of electric vehicles, which emit lower greenhouse gases compared to traditional fossil fuel-powered vehicles. This aligns with the University of Exeter's sustainability goals by reducing the carbon footprint associated with campus transportation, contributing to the university's aim for a carbon net-zero impact by 2030.
